### IPL 2025: A Game of Profits or Pitfalls?

The Indian Premier League (IPL) has evolved into a colossal economic engine, attracting billions in advertising revenue and transforming the sports-entertainment landscape. However, the growing dominance of fantasy gaming platforms and pan masala brands—now accounting for over 50% of all ad spots—has triggered public concern about the tournament’s social and ethical responsibilities.

This project aims to dissect the duality of IPL 2025 by delivering a data-driven, visually immersive report that:

Quantifies the league’s economic contributions across demographics and advertiser categories,

Unveils key revenue trends and brand associations, and

Exposes the potential social and health ramifications tied to excessive promotion of high-risk or harmful products.

The ultimate goal is to help stakeholders, from businesses to policymakers, understand the trade-offs between commercial success and social responsibility—and spark conversations that drive more ethical brand alignments in sports broadcasting.
